# Peg-Solitaire-Solver
Final project for my introduction to programming course in MATLAB

The goal for this project was to create a program capable of analyzing images of physical games of peg solitaire, record the layout of the board in the program and then map out every solution to the game using a breadth first search.

The program is separated into three different scripts:
1. Analyze the images and determine board and peg layout
2. Utilize a breadth first search algorithm to determine and record every solution to the game
3. A main program to call on the previously mentioned programs
